Hello Hub of Git!

My name is Sam. I have a basic understanding of python coding structure (really, really basic), but am looking to learn more. I am very interested in open-source software and have been using mostly Ubuntu based operating systems for three years now. Almost full time, except for needing to use Solidworks for school.
